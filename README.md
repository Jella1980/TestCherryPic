The project is a final step towards building the desktop application having a dummy application of squaring a number, the functionality comes through AstrosubscribeDll
The dummy application has a Login interface to interact with the astrouser server which validates the user login, subscription period, product ID.
Based on the renewal, a new activation key is generated through a web service on astrouser. The key is placed inside a folder in appdata path in Astrosubscribe folder
The user will not know all the activities behind the scene.  He will only know the remaining days and the links to renew and upgrade the product.
